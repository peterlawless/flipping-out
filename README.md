## Synopsis

This project is my first experience with Matplotlib and Jupyter notebook.
I created function to simulate flipping a coin, then a function that would run
that simulation as many times as the user told it to and record the results
for each iteration that was a power of 2.

Using Matplotlib in Jupyter notebook, I made a series of graphs to represent
the results of my simulations.  To no surprise, I found out that a coin toss
is a fair 50-50, normally distributed random variable.
